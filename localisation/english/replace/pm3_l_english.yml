 news.42.t: "Prigozhin's Plane Disaster"
 news.42.d: "The Russian passenger plane was destroyed today while flying from Moscow from Saint Petersburg. For reasons not yet determined, the airship was engulfed in flames and crashed to the ground, claiming 10 lives.\n\nOne of the plane's passengers was Evgeniy Prigozhin, leader of the private military company "Wagner". It is widely speculated that the plane was shot down by the russian air defence as a revenge for the failed coup attempt two months prior to the disaster. \n\nKremlin has not yet responded to the situation and the status of Evgeniy Prigozhin is yet to be confirmed."
 news.42.a: "Oh, the humanity!"
 news.43.t: "The Prigozhin Plane Incident"
 news.43.d: "Disaster was narrowly averted today, when a bomb was discovered on the Russian passenger plane with Evgeniy Prigozhin on board. Prigozhin quickly threw the bomb through the window and it landed on the Russian anti-air guns which were destroyed by the explosion.\n\nHad it gone unnoticed, the whole plane would be destroyed, causing Evgeniy Prigozhin and the other 9 passengers to die. \n\nIt's still unknown who planted the bomb, some speculate that it might have been planted by the Russian government as a revenge for the failed coup attempt two months prior to the incident." 
 news.43.a: "A close call."
